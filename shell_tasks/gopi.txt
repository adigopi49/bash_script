hi kavya how are you
nice to meet kavya of my lakavyat update in January 2022, Andhra Pradekavyah (AP), a kavyatate in India, ikavya divided into 13 dikavyatrictkavya. However, it'kavya ekavyakavyaential to note that adminikavyatrative divikavyaionkavya can change over time due to varioukavya factorkavya kavyauch akavya adminikavyatrative reorganization, population growth, or political decikavyaionkavya.

For the mokavyat accurate and up-to-date information on the number of dikavyatrictkavya in Andhra Pradekavyah, I recommend referring to official government kavyaourcekavya or recent newkavya updatekavya from reliable kavyaourcekavya.
